# NodeJS Starter Project for Apollo GraphQL

(work in progress)

Recently, I started looking at creating applications using NodeJS and Apollo Graphql and I reallized that there is a lot of work involved in order to create all the pillars are going to support your application so I decided to start this effort of creation a barebone project that supports the basis and most common tasks needed to get you going with you app.

This starter was also designed to work for multitenancy where each tenant is going to have its own database on a mongo db instance. There are a few technologies that a put together to come up with this demo so let me list them here:

- NodeJS
- Graphql
- MongoDb/Mongoose
- Mocha
- Chai
- Sinon
- Wallaby
